# React Web App Boilerplate

## Purpose

This is a boilerplate template designed specifically for agentic coding agents to quickly generate React web applications. By cloning this boilerplate, AI agents can significantly speed up the development process and ensure more reliable, consistent React app implementations.

## What This Boilerplate Provides

- **Modern React setup** with TypeScript configuration
- **Vite build tool** for fast development and optimized builds (`vite.config.ts`)
- **React Router** configuration for client-side routing (`react-router.config.ts`)
- **TypeScript configuration** (`tsconfig.json`) for type safety
- **Package management** with pre-configured dependencies (`package.json`)
- **Initialization scripts** (`bin/init`) for quick project setup
- **Run scripts** (`bin/run`) for easy development server startup
- **Structured app directory** with routes and components organization
- **Welcome components** with branding assets (logos for light/dark themes)
- **License file** for open-source compliance

## For Agentic Coding Agents

This boilerplate serves as a reliable foundation that eliminates the need to:
- Set up React, TypeScript, and Vite configuration from scratch
- Configure React Router for single-page application routing
- Create basic project structure and component organization
- Set up build tools and development scripts
- Handle initial styling and theming setup

By starting with this template, agents can focus on implementing specific UI components and application logic rather than boilerplate configuration, resulting in faster development cycles and more consistent code quality.

## Usage

1. Clone this boilerplate as the starting point for a new React web application
2. Run the initialization script: `./bin/init`
3. Implement your specific components and routes in the `app/` directory
4. Use the run script to start the development server: `./bin/run`
